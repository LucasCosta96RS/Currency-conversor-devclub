# Currency Exchanger Spider Man Themed

This project serves as a currency converter, it allows for users to choose the currency they want to convert. It gave me a big sense of accomplishment for finishing it, because it was a challenge from my mentor and was something a did on my own. I used two API's to get the current exchange for different coins, used the calc() feature to help me improve responsiveness, and did my best to get it as close to what i wanted to do.
